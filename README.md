# CCNA-Practice-Labs
This repository has the labs from Jeremy's IT Lab CCNA playlist. The labs are in a .pkt extension, which can be accessed through <a href="https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer">Cisco Packet Tracer software</a> (Create a netacad account, then the download should be in the resources section). The solutions to the labs have been worked out by me. Feel free to use these solutions to aid study.
